    "Monte Carlo Simulation is a great tool for business decision making under uncertainty, and it is well known in the Project Management domain. Instead of providing a simple predicted average project completion time, one could find a range of possible dates for completion. When you give an average completion prediction, there is a chance as high as 50% that one is going miss the deadline; however, no one likes to hear pessimistic estimates which would likely lead to the project bid won by a different team with a lower estimate (whether that is realistic or not). Monte Carlo Simulation in this case, could give you an idea of the possible distribution of the project completion time, which would then allow you to quote and make decisions that incorporates uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to explore ways that one can apply Monte Carlo Simulation in predictiong project completion date and assess project risk. The workbook is divided into multiple scenarios, each one incorporating more uncertainty or elements than the one prior. We encourage you to create your own Jupytor notebook and follow along. Alternatively, you can also download this specific Jupytor notebook [here](https://github.com/Master-of-Business-Analytics/Code_repository)\n",
